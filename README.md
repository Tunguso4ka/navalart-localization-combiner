# navalart localization combiner

## this script may break your localization file, all you need to fix it - delete \<feff> on the start of some lines

this script combines all official localization files into one and then replaces values from the mod, so it easier to work on localization mods after game update.

MIGHT NOT WORK ON WINDOWS
